# Challenge 3
 
This project is using JavaScript to create an automobile for controlling speed via braking and accelerating approaches.‚Äù. A Car initializes make as well as the speed of the car; make(brand) and speed(the car's current speed at the time setting is made). To speed up the car by 10km/h, a function called accelerate is created with its responsibility of logging the new speed into the console after this incrementation. Function brake also decrements the rate at which it moves while lengthening the distance covered within a specified period before it reports new updated values on the console screen one after another.
